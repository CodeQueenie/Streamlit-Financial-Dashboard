Note:
    When changing ticker in different page it will replace the already chosen ticker in the "Summary" page as well. Whatever ticker is chosen in "Summary" will be the default ticker throughout other pages. Do we want this or change? Should it be the same ticker from summary or ability to reset with different ticker in each page?
